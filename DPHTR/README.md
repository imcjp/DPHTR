The folder is the toolkit for differential privacy hierarchy tree release (DPHTR).

The main code structures are as follows:

1. **coreOfTree**: We implemented the major functions related to hierarchical trees, including building hierarchical trees, applying Generation Matrix to process hierarchical trees, etc.
2. **dpRelease**: We have implemented multiple DPHTR algorithms for consistency release, as follows.
Processless: No processing after adding noise.
Boosting[1]: The classic optimally consistent release only for complete tree.
PrivTrie[2]: The optimally consistent release for any hierarchical tree in [2]
GMC[3]: The optimally consistent release based on GM.
ForcePos: Set the negative noise node to 0 for non-negtive release.
IPC: The general quadratic programming algorithm for optimally non-negtive consistent release by Interior Point Convex Method.
GMNC: Our optimally non-negtive consistent release based on GM.
3. **noiseMeches**: We implement Laplace mechanism and Gaussian mechanism to provide privacy protection, where the Gaussian mechanism is implemented with the theory of f-DP[4].
4. **tools**: Some tools for our work.
