# Code for Comparison of multiple Gaussian Mechanisms

We implemented and compared various Gaussian Mechanisms, which are the classical Gaussian Mechanisms[1], RDP-based Gaussian Mechanisms[2], analytical Gaussian Mechanisms[3], enhanced RDP-based Gaussian Mechanisms[4], and Gaussian Mechanisms based on f-DP[5].

Please run **"compareGaussMechs.m"** for comparison. One of the results already obtained is
